# Welcome to the Secure Cloud-Native Solutions Project by Techies

Dedicated to building robust, scalable, and secure cloud-native applications for the financial sector! This initiative tackles the ever-present challenges of data privacy, integrity, and compliance within the fast-moving cloud-native landscape.

## Project Focus:

We're developing a comprehensive **Cloud-Native Security Framework** encompassing the entire application lifecycle. This framework is anchored on the four pillars of cloud-native security: **Code**, **Container**, **Cluster**, and **Cloud** (the four C's).

### Libraries Used in the Code

**bcrypt**

Securely hashes passwords using the bcrypt algorithm, a password-hashing function designed to be slow and resistant to brute-force attacks. Essential for protecting sensitive user data in applications. Bcrypt can handle passwords up to 72 characters.

**boto3**

Boto3 is the Python SDK for interacting with AWS services. It provides an object-oriented API for creating, modifying, and managing resources across various AWS services. Handle exceptions gracefully to ensure code robustness.
