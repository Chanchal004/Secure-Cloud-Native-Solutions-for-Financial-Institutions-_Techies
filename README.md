# Welcome to the Secure Cloud-Native Solutions Project by Techies

Dedicated to building robust, scalable, and secure cloud-native applications for the financial sector! This initiative tackles the ever-present challenges of data privacy, integrity, and compliance within the fast-moving cloud-native landscape.

## Project Focus:

We're developing a comprehensive **Cloud-Native Security Framework** encompassing the entire application lifecycle. This framework is anchored on the four pillars of cloud-native security: **Code**, **Container**, **Cluster**, and **Cloud** (the four C's).

### Libraries Used in the Code

**bcrypt**

Securely hashes passwords using the bcrypt algorithm, a password-hashing function designed to be slow and resistant to brute-force attacks. Essential for protecting sensitive user data in applications. Bcrypt can handle passwords up to 72 characters.

**boto3**

Boto3 is the Python SDK for interacting with AWS services. It provides an object-oriented API for creating, modifying, and managing resources across various AWS services. Handle exceptions gracefully to ensure code robustness.

# Architecture Overview

## Database Service (Amazon DynamoDB)
A powerful NoSQL database service tailored for efficient storage and management of transaction data.

Facilitates high-performance queries and scales seamlessly with your application's growing data needs.

Ensures data reliability and availability through built-in backup and restore capabilities.

## Containerization (Docker)
Utilizes Docker to encapsulate application components into portable and isolated containers.

Enhances efficiency by streamlining development, testing, and deployment processes.

Promotes consistency across diverse environments, minimizing potential issues.

## Container Deployment (ECS)
Leverages Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) for efficient container deployment and management.

Scales effortlessly to accommodate varying workloads, optimizing resource utilization.

Highly scalable and integrates seamlessly with other AWS services.

## Cluster Management (EKS)
Utilizes Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for effective cluster management.

Empowers the application with features such as automatic scaling, self-healing, and load balancing.

Ensures robustness and resilience in handling containerized workloads.

## Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
Enhances security by safeguarding sensitive data through AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

Provides secure storage and management of encryption keys.

Ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and access control.

## Cloud Services (AWS)
Harnesses various AWS cloud services to create a comprehensive cloud-native architecture.

Leverages Amazon S3 for scalable and durable object storage.

Utilizes CloudWatch for real-time monitoring, logging, and alarming.

Explores additional AWS services to meet specific application requirements.
