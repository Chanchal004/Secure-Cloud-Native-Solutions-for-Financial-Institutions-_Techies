# Welcome to the Secure Cloud-Native Solutions Project by Techies

Dedicated to building robust, scalable, and secure cloud-native applications for the financial sector! This initiative tackles the ever-present challenges of data privacy, integrity, and compliance within the fast-moving cloud-native landscape.

## Project Focus:

We're developing a comprehensive **Cloud-Native Security Framework** encompassing the entire application lifecycle. This framework is anchored on the four pillars of cloud-native security: **Code**, **Container**, **Cluster**, and **Cloud** (the four C's).

### Libraries Used in the Code

**bcrypt**

Securely hashes passwords using the bcrypt algorithm, a password-hashing function designed to be slow and resistant to brute-force attacks. Essential for protecting sensitive user data in applications. Bcrypt can handle passwords up to 72 characters.

**boto3**

Boto3 is the Python SDK for interacting with AWS services. It provides an object-oriented API for creating, modifying, and managing resources across various AWS services. Handle exceptions gracefully to ensure code robustness.

# Architecture Overview

## Database Service (Amazon DynamoDB)
A NoSQL database service is used to store and manage transaction data.

## Containerization (Docker)
Application components are packaged into containers for portability, isolation, and efficient resource utilization.

## Container Deployment (ECS)
Containers are deployed and managed using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), a highly scalable container orchestration service.

## Cluster Management (EKS)
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is used to manage the cluster of containers, providing features for scaling, self-healing, and load balancing.

## Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
Sensitive data is protected using AWS Key Management Service, which provides secure key storage and management.

## Cloud Services (AWS)
The application leverages various AWS cloud services, including S3 for storage, CloudWatch for monitoring, and potentially others.
